# Energy Usage Prediction

## Flatiron School Capstone Project

### Author: Matthew Danielson

This project is the capstone project for the Data Science Bootcamp at the Flatiron School. It is based on the kaggle competition ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III. https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction

## Background

Buildings have been retrofit with energy saving improvements with a payment plan relative to difference in real consumption and predicted values. Accurate models are required to predict energy consumption as if improvements were never made. 

The training dataset contains
